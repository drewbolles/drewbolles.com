I’ve begun the undertaking of converting my portfolio to Jekyll &#x26; GitHub pages. So far, it’s been a great experience, no huge hurdles. The Jekyll documentation is slick, and makes everything super easy. Just download the gem…run $ jekyll new project-name…and you’re off and running.</p>\n<p>One of the coolest parts is for sure the GitHub pages integration. GitHub will host your Jekyll site for free. What a deal! It’s really cool and makes deployment super simple.</p>\n<p>Hopefully more blogs to come!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Jekyll Post","date":"Invalid date"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013/12/17/2013-12-17-first-jekyll-post/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2015/05/01/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}}}
