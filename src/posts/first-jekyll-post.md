This is my first Jeykll post! I've begun the undertaking of converting my portfolio to Jekyll & GitHub pages. So far, it's been a great experience, no huge hurdles. The Jekyll documentation is slick, and makes everything super easy. Just download the gem...run $ jekyll new project-name...and you're off and running.

One of the coolest parts is for sure the GitHub pages integration. GitHub will host your Jekyll site for free. What a deal! It's really cool and makes deployment super simple.

Hopefully more blogs to come!
